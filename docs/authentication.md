# Authentication Process

When a user enters a username and password in the `/auth` route, that information is verified against the `Users` table in the middle-layer database. This table contains the usernames and their encrypted password. Once the user is authenticated, the application sends back a token that can be used for any of the API routes. The token is valid for two hours. Note that only userrole 'admin'—not userrole 'user'— has permission to access all routes.

## How It Works

A separate route, `/auth`, was created to generate a token. This token-based authentication is handled using four `npm` modules: 

- `Passport`, the authentication middleware
- `passport-local`
- `bcrypt-nodejs`
- `jsonwebtoken`

This API uses the `passport-local` strategy. This strategy authenticates users with a username and password and verifies that information against the database. When the user enters a username and password, the `bcrypt-nodejs` module verifies the submitted password against the hash in the database. Upon successful authentication, the application sends back a token using the `jsonwebtoken` module. The `jsonwebtoken` module uses a secret key, stored as an environment variable, to generate the token, which is set to be valid for 120 minutes.
