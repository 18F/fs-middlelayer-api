# Environment Variables

These are the environment variables that must be created on the Node.js server for the application to run:

## Required for Production and Testing

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<database hostname>:5432<database name>`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secret key to generate tokens>`
- `VCAP_SERVICES=an object to replicate the bound services of the SUDS_API_URL and the S3 bucket`

## Creating API User Accounts Using Environment Variables

User accounts will be created only if these variable are present:

- `ADMINROLE_USER=<admin role account username>`
- `ADMINROLE_HASH=<admin role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`
- `USERROLE_USER=<user role account username>`
- `USERROLE_HASH=<user role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`

## Setting AWS Credentials

The Node.js server will look for the AWS properties in the system's environment variables first. If they are not found, the server will look for the credentials file under the `.aws` directory. Refer to [Setting Credentials in Node.js](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) for more information.

## Setting Environment Variables

The [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) npm package is used to load environment variables to the application for local development.
