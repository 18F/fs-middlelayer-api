# Environment Variables

These are the environment variables that must be created on the Node.js server for the application to run:

## Required for Production

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<database hostname>:5432<database name>`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secret key to generate tokens>`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key ID>`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret key>`
- `AWS_REGION=<AWS region>`
- `AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<AWS S3 bucket name>`
- `SUDS_API_URL=<SUDS Basic API URL>`

## Required for Testing

- `ADMINROLE_USER=<admin role account username>`
- `ADMINROLE_PWD=<admin role account password>`
- `ADMINROLE_HASH=<admin role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`
- `USERROLE_USER=<user role account username>`
- `USERROLE_PWD=<user role account password>`
- `USERROLE_HASH=<user role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`

## Setting AWS Credentials

The Node.js server will look for the AWS properties in the environment variables first. If they are not found, the server will look for the credentials file under the .aws directory. Refer to [Setting Credentials in Node.js](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) for more information.

## Setting Environment Variables

The dotenv npm package is used to load to provide environment variables to the application. For more information, refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
