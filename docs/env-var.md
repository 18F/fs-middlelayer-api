# Environment Variables

These are the environment variables that must be created on the Node.js server for the application to run:

## Required for Production and Testing

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<database hostname>:5432<database name>`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secret key to generate tokens>`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key ID>`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret key>`
- `AWS_REGION=<AWS region>`
- `AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<AWS S3 bucket name>`
- `SUDS_API_URL=<SUDS Basic API URL>`

## Required for Testing Only

- `ADMINROLE_USER=<admin role account username>`
- `ADMINROLE_PWD=<admin role account password>`
- `ADMINROLE_HASH=<admin role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`
- `USERROLE_USER=<user role account username>`
- `USERROLE_PWD=<user role account password>`
- `USERROLE_HASH=<user role account password’s hash generated by bcrypt>`

## Setting AWS Credentials

The Node.js server will look for the AWS properties in the system's environment variables first. If they are not found, the server will look for the credentials file under the `.aws` directory. Refer to [Setting Credentials in Node.js](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) for more information.

## Setting Environment Variables

The [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) npm package is used to load environment variables to the application for local development.
