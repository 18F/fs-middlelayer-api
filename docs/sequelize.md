# Sequelize

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication, and more.

## Migrations

Table creation uses the migration scripts located under `/dba/migrations`.

1. Install `sequelize-cli` globally using the command `npm install -g sequelize-cli`.
2. Make sure the database URL is available as the environment variable, set as `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Run `sequelize db:migrate` to create the tables.

## Seeders

Seeders, the data that will populate the database, are located under `/dba/seeders`.
To run the seeders, run `sequelize db:seed:all`.

## Models

Models are a JavaScript factory class that represents a table in the database. Models are located under `/src/models`.
