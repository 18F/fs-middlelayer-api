# Sequelize

The middle-layer database stores application fields that are not supported by the SUDS database. The middle-layer API uses Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM, to access the middle-layer database. For more information, refer to the [Sequelize documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/).

## Models

Models are a JavaScript factory class that represents a table in the database. Models are located under `/src/models`.
